## Overview

This repository contains the assignments for the course "Simulation and Modeling of Dynamic Systems" at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (ECE AUTH) for the early semester of the 2024-2025 academic year. The work focuses on parameter estimation, 
system analysis, real-time identification, and modeling of both linear and nonlinear dynamic systems.
